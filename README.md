# DINOv2 for cell classification

This project is a fork of the DINOv2 repo published by meta, aiming to use the methodology presented in their papers to train a series of
model on blood white cells images.  
Developping a foundation model for blood white cells is interesting for several reasons:

- The categories of blood white cells are not unanimous, and hematologists / datasets make different classes.
- Some blood white cells present mutations that are visible on images, and those distinguishible features could be embedded by the model
